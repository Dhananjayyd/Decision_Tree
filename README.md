# Decision_Tree

>A decision tree is a type of machine learning model that is used for both classification and regression tasks. It is a tree-like model in which each internal node >represents a test on an attribute or feature, each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label or a numerical value.

>In a decision tree, each node represents a feature or attribute, and each branch represents a decision or a possible outcome of that feature. The topmost node in the
>
>tree is called the root node, and the final outcomes are called leaf nodes. The decision tree algorithm works by recursively splitting the data into smaller subsets 
>
>based on the features that are most informative in predicting the target variable.
